# FinanceInsight Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only scaffold (demo mode). Replace the demo upload handler in `src/pages/Upload.jsx` with an axios POST to your backend endpoint (e.g. `/predict`) when backend is ready.
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs`.
