Apple Inc. reported strong financial performance for the fourth quarter of FY2025, with total revenue reaching $97.4 billion, marking a 6.8% year-over-year increase driven primarily by higher iPhone and Services sales. The companyâ€™s net income stood at $24.6 billion, supported by robust demand across North America and Asia-Pacific regions, despite ongoing global supply chain constraints.
Operating expenses rose modestly by 3.2%, mainly due to increased R&D spending on artificial intelligence and wearable technologies. Apple also announced a $20 billion share repurchase program, reflecting continued confidence in its long-term growth and cash flow stability.
